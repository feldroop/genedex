# Possible Future Extensions and Improvements (roughly in order of priority):

### High priority: index for single texts

- more flexible alphabet API
    - allow alphabet with sentinel included in io representation
    - allow alphabet without sentinel (only usable for single text indexing)
- optimized version for single text without sentinel
- optimized construction directly from (fasta) file reader

### Nice to have, higher priority

- space optimization for rarely occurring symbols (such as the sentinel and N in the human Genome)
    - maybe leverage the fact that such characters (namely N) often occur in runs
    - the sentinel can not be searched. the current sampled suffix array implementation has special handling for it.
        so it technically doesn't have to be stored in the text with rank support. If N also gets special handling,
        the condensed text with rank support will get smaller and maybe faster. 
        A text sampled suffix array could be an option, or a "sparse" text with rank support substructure.
- paired blocks for improved memory usage when using larger alphabets
- in the search, `lookup_tables::compute_lookup_idx_static_len` still seems to be one of the bottlenecks. this
    should be investigated further, maybe it can be optimized or it's a measuring error.
- the batching of search queries could be improved. Currenty, it is not efficent if the queries have very different lengths
    or if many of them quickly get an empty interval, while others need ot be searched to the very end.
- functionality to directly retrieve maximal exact matches 
- more documentation tests

### Large topics, is the goal to eventually support

- bidirectional FM-Index
- searches with errors and "degenerate" chars in IUPAC fasta definition (using search schemes)

### Nice to have, but low priority

- gate rayon/OpenMP usage behind feature flag
- API to use batched search with cursors
- type-erase index storage type and choose automatically for text size (does that work with savefile?)
- optional functionality for text recovery
- text sampled suffix array (with text ids and optionally other annotations)
- suffix array, lookup table compression using unconventional int widths (e.g. 33 bit)
- optimized functions for reading directly from input files: both for texts to build the index and queries to search.
    the latter might be more important, because for simple searches, the search can be faster than reading the 
    queries from disk.

### Large topics, might never happen

- FMD-Index
- word-based FM-Indices
- optimizations for highly repetitive texts such as run length encoding (r-index)
- ropeBWT/dynamic FM-Index
