/// A trait for data structures central to the FM-Index of this library.
///
/// They can answer rank queries similar to the ones for bitvectors with rank support,
/// but for a text with a given number of different symbols.
///
/// Currently, two different implementations exist, [`CondensedTextWithRankSupport`] and
/// [`FlatTextWithRankSupport`]. Both of them can also be used with different block sizes (more info [here](Block)).
///
/// The condensed version is more space efficient, which is especially relevant for larger alphabets.
/// The flat version is a bit faster, but has a higher memory usage.
///
/// In total, [`FlatTextWithRankSupport<Block64>`] is the fastest, and [`CondensedTextWithRankSupport<Block512>`]
/// is the smallest configuration.
///
/// An example of how this data structure is used can be found
/// [here](https://github.com/feldroop/genedex/blob/master/examples/text_with_rank_support.rs).
